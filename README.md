# c2pa-cam: Demo for c2pa-ios

This demo is based on Apple's Sample Code [AVCam](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avcam-building-a-camera-app)

It was augmented to demonstrate the usage of https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-ios/ 

When a image or video is captured, it will create and embed a minimal manifest stating the creation of the asset.

Please note, that it currently uses invalid demo keys for its purpose.
